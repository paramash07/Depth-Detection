# Model Configuration

model:
  name: "MiDaS"  # Model name: MiDaS, FastDepth, or MonoDepth2
  version: "DPT_Large"  # Model version/variant
  weights_path: "../models/weights/midas_v3_dpt_large.pt"  # Path to model weights
  device: "cuda"  # Device to run model on: "cuda" or "cpu"
  input_size: [384, 384]  # Input resolution [height, width]

preprocessing:
  normalize_mean: [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]  # ImageNet mean
  normalize_std: [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]   # ImageNet std
  resize_mode: "bilinear"  # Interpolation mode for resizing

postprocessing:
  min_depth: 0.1  # Minimum depth value in meters
  max_depth: 100.0  # Maximum depth value in meters
  depth_scale: 1.0  # Scale factor for depth values

thresholds:
  safe_distance: 5.0    # Distance in meters for safe zone
  warning_distance: 3.0  # Distance in meters for warning zone
  danger_distance: 1.5  # Distance in meters for danger zone
